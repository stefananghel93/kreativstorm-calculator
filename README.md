# 💻 KREATIVSTORM - Calculator Project 

## ✏️ Project description
Our goal was to create a calculator with some features

## 👩‍💻 Development Rules
- All of the basic math operators
- Add a “clear” button.
- Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons
- Figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them.
- Fix these bugs if they show up in your code:
- a. Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer,with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.
- b. Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).
- c. You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- d. Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
- e. Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data
- f. Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0
- g. Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. 
- h. Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
- i. Add keyboard support!
